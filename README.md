# myweb
Basic web site with navigation.
myweb directory has the html, css, js, and bootstrap code to display the web site.  myweb directory also has the Dockerfile to build a docker image.  
Kubernetes directory is in progress. Currently it has he deployment config example to deploy the docker image to kubernetes cluster.
Argocd has a manifest yaml file that Argo (https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/) uses to autodeploy the docker image.  I plan on doing more with Argo.
